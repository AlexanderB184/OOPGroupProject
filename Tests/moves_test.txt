Test 1: Attack_Move and Heal_Move (when exceeding full health)
Test 2: Attack_Move and Heal_Move (when not exceeding full health)
Test 3: Applying a status condition with Status_Move
Test 4: Attacking and applying a status condition with Special_Attack_Move
Test 5: Killing with an Attack_Move (and attacking a zero HP Target)
Test 6: Killing with a Special_Attack_Move (and attempting to inflict status on a killing blow)

All tests also test the random chance to miss

Initial version: tests 1 and 2

It was subsequently updated to include test 3, and then 4. This also required
a rework to match the updated version of the character class.

Final update added tests 5 and 6

Test 6 had a problem with inflicting a status condition on a non-killing blow.
It turns out that the accuracy check was accidentally implemented backwards.
This has been fixed.

As of 17/10/22, all 6 tests work as intended
